# glider-dependency-graph
Extracts the dependency graph of a glider from two canonical configurations. Can reconstruct the original geometry from the abstract dependency graph.

See Randall Beer's papers on gliders in the game of life to see what exactly is meant by "process", "dependency graph", etc. This algorithm is an implementation of the one described in an upcoming paper by Beer, McShaffrey, and Gaul "Deriving the intrinsic viability constraint of an emergent individual from first principles."

The code here has not been polished or fully commented yet, so I apologize for the lack of readability.
